"In lexical analysis, tokenization is the process of breaking a stream of text up into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens. The list of tokens becomes input for further processing such as parsing or text mining." -[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(lexical_analysis)
